Nuggies
==============

Most fun you'll ever have with nuggets

Problem
-------
I would really really  like to learn how to use object recognition technology. 

Goals
-------

* Have my camera recognize a nugget (veggie, chicken, fish).
* Once object is recognized, add face to nugget.
* Animate face (maybe make it wink);

Tools
-------
* Native iOS camera function (Objective - C)
* OpenVC Object Recognition Libraries (Possibly C++)
* If you have any questions read me at [my twitter].

Work in progress. Please stay tuned.
